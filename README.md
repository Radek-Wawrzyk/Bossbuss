# Bossbuss site
Site it has created for my client who has transport and deliver company. I've got PSD file from my graphic designer and it has been PSD2HTML job.
In this project i've used Jquery and slider, animation libraries. I've had free hand to do some animations, hover effects and etc.
I think that the effect is good, also site is fast enough, so i'm happy what i've done. 

Technologies i've used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- LESS
- Jquery
- AOS.js
- Owl carousel
